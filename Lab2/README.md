This dataset is about how customers shop in a retail store. It has information like:
Age and gender of customers
What items they buy and how much they spend
Payment methods and whether they use discounts
How often they shop
We can use it to see patterns in shopping habits, like what types of customers there are, how promotions affect their behavior, and how much they usually spend. It’s great for exploring data and learning more about different kinds of shoppers.
Machine Learning Problem:
This is a clustering problem, because we want to group similar customers together based on their shopping habits.
Goal: The model should find patterns in the data to identify different customer segments. For example, it could separate customers who buy a lot but rarely use discounts from those who shop frequently and always use promotions. This can help stores make better decisions, like targeting the right customers for marketing or recommending products.
